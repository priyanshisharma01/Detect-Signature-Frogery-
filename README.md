## Overview

Our project main focuses on banking security. We have designed a DL model integrated with an android application which can analyze and predicting whether the signature is genuine or forgery.
As we all know the signature forgery is very common in India which can cause a huge loss to customers. Our model will solve this problem efficiently.


## Working Methodology
Our model is based on a CNN learning. We have used computer vision to identify and recognize the original and forgery signature. Our model is trained on over 4000+ signature images and gives and accuracy of 94%. We have then integrated out model to a android application which help easy to use the model to scan and analyze the signature.
